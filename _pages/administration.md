|-Facilitated and signed transfer agreements with a number of Colleges and Universities in Saskatchewan and Alberta and established satellite engineering campuses in Saskatchewan in order to further increase enrollment for the College.|
|-In 2014, inaugurated an annual month long program of visits, by students from Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University (PDPU) of India in order to showcase our facilities and recruit graduate students from India.|
|-Established new means of communicating directly with undergraduate and graduate students by instituting town hall meetings held during each academic term.|
|-Revitalized and staffed the Saskatchewan Centre of Excellence in Transportation and Infrastructure (SCETI) which is the main funding agency for innovative research regarding transportation and road infrastructure. It is located in the College of Engineering and its Director report to the Dean who is the chair of the Advisory Council of SCETI.|
|-Created the University’s first “Search for Experts” public searchable database engine, available for the College of Engineering.|
|-Started the process of engineering building renewal and expansion planning by selecting a team of architectural firms to draft the master plan that will allow the reconfiguration and expansion of the 100 year old building in a way to accommodate the student number expansion that started during my tenure. In the first stage about 70% of the books in Engineering library were securely placed in another library (available upon request) and that created space for student groups to study.|

### 2000-2005 - Assistant Dean, Faculty of Engineering, Dalhousie University

### 1997-2000 - Vice-Chair, Dalhousie University Senate, Dalhousie University 
Halifax, N.S.

The Dalhousie University Senate is the governing academic body of the university. It is comprised of 73 ex-officio and elected members from the Faculties of the university. The three officers of the Senate are the Chair, Vice-Chair and the Secretary. The Senate, as the elected governing body of the university, approves new programs, oversees the review of existing programs and ensures that comprehensive budget policies are followed.

|**Major Accomplishments**:|
|-My tenure in the Dalhousie University Senate (1997-2000) provided me with the opportunity to obtain a strong understanding of how the university works and to exercise fairness, equity and openness. I have also developed a better understanding and appreciation of the position of Faculties other than Engineering, within the university community.|
|-As Vice-Chair of the Senate of Dalhousie University, in addition to other duties, I was in charge of organizing and carrying, through the Senate Academic Priorities and Budget Committee (SAPBC), the reviews of the Faculties of the university and other affiliated universities.|
|-During my tenure, I oversaw the reviews of the Faculties of Medicine, Science, Arts and Social Sciences, Graduate Studies, and I initiated the review of the Faculties of Architecture and Engineering. These reviews involved Faculty self studies, submissions and interviews to review committees, visits, by invitation, of external referees who advised the Senate on the status of the specific Faculty in Canadian and International Academia.  The Senate reviews the final report and its recommendations are implemented within 18 months.|
|-I was also responsible for overseeing the reviews of the Institutions affiliated with Dalhousie that offer Dalhousie degrees.  During my term as Vice-Chair, we conducted the review of the Nova Scotia Agricultural College and King’s College. I also had an opportunity to participate as a committee member in the review of the Department of Chemistry.|
|-My participation in, and occasional chairing of the Senate and the Senate Academic Priorities and Budget Committee (SAPBC), has resulted in  enhancing my knowledge on the academic and budgetary approval of academic programs as well as the management of multi-faculty and multidisciplinary programs, which, I feel, will become very important in the future.|
