## Research Interests

My research interests lie in the fields of Materials and Metallurgical Engineering - in fundamental science and engineering applications, in the field of value-added metallurgy, and in the area of Chemistry and Processing of Materials.

My primary interest is the electrochemical engineering of molten salt electrolysis. Specific areas of fundamental research are the thermodynamic, electrochemical and spectroscopic properties of reactive metal halide systems as apply to the production of the metals or coating of the metals. In addition I explore the recycling of reactive metals, and utilization of minerals in metal matrix composites. Metals of serious interest to me include the light, refractory and rare earth groups.

Other topics include electrochemical aspects of copper and nickel production from aqueous solutions. As well as the application of potentiodynamic techniques, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in the investigation of passivation and corrosion of materials.

Another major interest of mine is the development and processing of powder metallurgy (P/M) light metals alloys as a means to sustainability of parts manufacturing. I model the processes used in the production of P/M automotive components as well as study the mechanical properties. I examine surface engineering and its role in the corrosion protection of reactive metals P/M alloys

My secondary interests in engineering applications include the development of electrochemical sensors for use in the process control and optimization of high temperature chemical processes.

In the area of materials science and engineering my interest is in the study of the chemical stability of the interface between the second phase modification agent and the metal matrix in composites and powder metallurgy alloys. I work on the application of potentiodynamic techniques, cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy in the investigation of the corrosion of boride coatings on the surface of powder metallurgy alloys.

My work also explores the application of the scientific principles in the study and the development of phase-change materials. As a corollary of these studies the electrodeposition of metal matrix composites is also being investigated.

The primary value-added metallurgy component of the research explores the potential application of certain naturally-occurring industrial mineral fibres/whiskers/particulates as reinforcement in metal-matrix composites.  The use of certain minerals benification wastes as additives to metallurgical processes or as reinforcement in metal-matrix composites are also investigated. A secondary component of the research interests refer to the use of minerals in the development of inexpensive phase-change materials (PCM) for thermal storage.
